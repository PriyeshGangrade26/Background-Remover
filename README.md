Background Remover

Introduction:-

OpenCV

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that provides privileges to play with different images and video streams and also helps in end-to-end projects like
object detection, face detection, object tracking, etc.

CVzone

CVzone is a computer vision package that makes us easy to run like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc.
and also image processing and other AI functions. At the core, it uses OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries.

Popular background removal techniques:-

- Image clipping path – This technique is used if the subject of the image has sharp edges. All those elements that fall outside the path will be eliminated.

- Image cut-out – Here we cut the required region or subject in a frame and remove the background.

- Image masking – If the images have frills or fine edges we can use image masking techniques.

- Erasing the background – Erasing the background of an image using any different tools.
